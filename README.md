# Intermittent Hover Effect Failure in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where hover effects intermittently fail on specific elements.  The issue appears to be related to a conflict with other CSS or JavaScript code, but the root cause remains elusive.  This repository provides both the buggy code and a potential solution. 

## Bug Description

A hover effect defined using Tailwind CSS classes is not consistently applied to a particular element.  The element's classes seem correct and other elements using similar Tailwind classes behave as expected. The failure is not persistent and can sometimes be resolved by refreshing the page or performing unrelated actions, indicating a potential timing or conflict issue.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a local web server.
3. Open `bug.html` in your browser and observe the unexpected hover behavior on the button.

## Potential Solution

The solution might involve identifying and resolving a conflict with other CSS or JavaScript, or using more specific selectors or CSS overrides. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a potential workaround that uses more specific selectors.
